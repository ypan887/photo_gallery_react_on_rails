### Demo


#Getting Started

To get a clone running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. You need this: 

#### Rails
cd to the project directory and install the gem, you will need ruby and rails setup on your machice
```
$ bundle install
```

#### Postgresql
You will also need to setup postgresql in your machine. You can find a good instruction [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

If you are using figaro to manage your credentials like I did, put the following into `config/application.yml`

```
POSTGRES_USERNAME: Your postgresql username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: Your postgresql password
```

#### AWS
You will need you own AWS credential or you can choose to store files on your own server

If you are using figaro to manage your credentials like I did, put the following into `config/application.yml`

```
S3_BUCKET_NAME:   your bucket directory
S3_KEY:           your aws key id
S3_SECRET:        your aws secret
S3_REGION:        your region of you bucket
```

#### React
Now we need to get all the client side code working. cd into the client folder.
Make sure you have node and npm installed.

```
$ npm -i
```

#### Start

To start the server, you will need to run
```
$ foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

foreman will start both webpack and puma for you. You can now visit localhost:5000 to view the project.
